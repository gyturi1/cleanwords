# cleanwords

Cleaning, filtering the [hungarian webcorpus](ftp://ftp.mokk.bme.hu/Language/Hungarian/Freq/Web2.2/web2.2-freq-sorted.txt.gz) collecting the possible 5 letter words. It will contains false positive words, due to the specialty of double or tripple charachter letters in hungarian. So for example this tool classifies "a r รก ny" as a possible 5 letter word, although "a r รก n y" is not a valid spelling.

Further work can be done to eliminate false positives: does not checked but using the morphologically annotated webcorpus. Maybe the annotations contains the letter counts.
